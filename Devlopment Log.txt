Time Log of development of Rick's Place

Dec 2014 -- started development in earnest, selecting Refinery CMS

dec 17 -- switched database from MySQL to Postgres, after discovering that this is the
    preferred database at Heroku (and because most of open source community seems to
    moving away from MySQL and towards Postgres, because of how Oracle is mucking up MySQL)
    Installing Postgres w/ Refinery is tedious...see bookmark link under Resources.
    
    Switching the database seemed easier that dumping the data out of the MySQL version, then
    importing into the Postgres version, given the different data types between the two (even
    just on text and string types...)
