Time Log of development of Rick's Place

Dec 2014 -- started development in earnest, selecting Refinery CMS

dec 17 -- switched database from MySQL to Postgres, after discovering that this is the
    preferred database at Heroku (and because most of open source community seems to
    moving away from MySQL and towards Postgres, because of how Oracle is mucking up MySQL)
    Installing Postgres w/ Refinery is tedious...see bookmark link under Resources.
    
    Switching the database seemed easier that dumping the data out of the MySQL version, then
    importing into the Postgres version, given the different data types between the two (even
    just on text and string types...)
    
dec 22 -- got postgres working (need to follow blog installation steps exactly)
    Having trouble with styling and setting home page to resemble what I had done before;
    am following the Refinery Guides steps...up to 5.5, but still looks like crap...and is not
    displaying the correct home page.
    
dec 24 -- added this refinery extension: Events History, which I intend to start using
    to document events related to Front Range Fracking. 

    This was done by modifying the example in section 6.2 of the Refinery Guides, which
    looks like: 
    
        rails generate refinery:engine event title:string date:datetime photo:image blurb:text
    
    which I modified slightly to:
    
        rails generate refinery:engine event title:string date:datetime photo:image description:text

    This generated a new menu tab, Events.

dec 25 -- Want to improve positioning of the body, sidebar, footer and header....
    Tried starting with the footer:
        rake refinery:override view=refinery/_footer
    This created app/views/refinery/_footer.html.erb
