Development Notes

login: rick
password: rick

To reset a password:

    -- inside the rails console, you can enter
    `Refinery::User.find_by_email('your_...@gmail.com').tap {|u| u.password = 'new password' }.save`.
    
Editing the Homepage:
    - start rails: cd /Users/rickcasey/Projects/Programming/Website Projects/ricksplace
    - see Refinery dashboard, top page, 'Rick's Place'
    - inside Refinery, the homepage has a separate view at app/views/refinery/pages/home.html.erb
    
To force login:
    - URL: localhost:3000/refinery (once logged in, will see web editor)
    
Scripts that create other setup items:
 
    - to create role for users in Postgres DB:
    
    CREATE ROLE site_user;
    CREATE ROLE site_admin;
    CREATE USER rick ROLE site_admin;
    
    - commands to create heroku compatible Refinery app:
    
    refinerycms ricksplace --heroku
    createuser -P -d -e postgres
    createuser -P -d -e ricksplace
    ...then edit the database.yml file with the user login/password ricksplace
    
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    
    ...this finally worked.
    
changing of some basic default settings:
    - some of this is done by editing the controllers or views.
    to change the website name:
    edit config/initializers/refinery/core.rb, see config.site_name =... (requires restart)
    
to override the default header:
    rake refinery:override view=refinery/_header
    
to set the home page:
    docs say to run: rake db:seed
    which resulted in this message:
        I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future.
        If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set
        I18n.enforce_available_locales = false to avoid this message.
    Don't know about above message, but this did the trick: now the website appears...
